EDA Summary: Key Findings
1. Lab & Video Metadata Analysis
Finding: The dataset is a collection of videos from numerous different labs, each with a unique lab_id.

Key Insight: There's a severe imbalance in data contribution. The MABe22 and CalMS21 datasets provide the vast majority of the videos, creating a "long-tail" distribution where most labs contribute very little data.

Strategic Implication: This creates a high risk of our model overfitting to the conditions of the dominant labs. To get a high score, our model must generalize well to unseen labs. This confirms that using a GroupKFold validation strategy (splitting data by lab_id) is essential for building a robust model.

2. Behavior Label Analysis
Finding: We've identified over 30 distinct behaviors to classify.

Key Insight: There's a massive class imbalance among the behaviors. A few actions like sniff are extremely common, while many others like allogroom and ejaculate are incredibly rare.

Strategic Implication: This explains why the competition uses an F-score as its metricâ€”it forces us to build a model that can successfully identify the rare "needle in a haystack" behaviors. Our modeling approach must directly address this imbalance using techniques like class weights, resampling, or specialized loss functions.
